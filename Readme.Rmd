# ggformat

This is a one function addin package. My motivation in writing it was to make it easier to clean up and style **ggplot2** code.

Note: this is new -- please [report bugs or leave comments](https://github.com/jtr13/ggformat/issues/new)!

## Installation

`remotes::install_github("jtr13/ggformat")`

## Usage

Highlight code thats produce a single **ggplot2** graph, run the addin "Format ggplot2 code", and the code will be cleaned up and styled. For example, 

```
# BEFORE
mtcars |> group_by(cyl) |> summarize(mean_mpg = mean(mpg)) |> ggplot(aes(factor(cyl),
mean_mpg)) + theme_bw(14) + geom_col() + labs(title = "mtcars", x = "number of cylinders", y = "average miles per gallon")
```

will become:

```
# AFTER
mtcars |>
  group_by(cyl) |>
  summarize(mean_mpg = mean(mpg)) |>
  ggplot(aes(factor(cyl), mean_mpg)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "mtcars", x = "number of cylinders", y = "average miles per gallon") +
  theme_bw(14)
```

## What the styled code looks like

* `|>`s are followed by line breaks

* Each **ggplot2** function appears on its own line followed by a `+`. Misplaced `+`s, such as after the last function, are removed.

*  **ggplot2** functions are sorted based on the **ggplot2** template:


```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width = 3, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("ggplot2template.png")
```

Labeling functions (`ggtitle`, `labs`, `xlab`, `ylab`, `annotate`) are placed between scales and themes. Guides are added between labeling functions and themes.

The specific sort order is: 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
orderwords <- readLines("orderwords.txt")
orderwords <- gsub("\\\\\\(", "", orderwords)
orderwords[-1]
```

* If there are multiple instances of a function type, for example, multiple geoms, the current order is preserved.

* You can easily set your own sort order by forking the project and changing the `splitwords` variable in [ggformat.R](R/ggformat.R).

## How it differs from other formatting packages

* THE BIG DIFFERENCE: Neither **formatR** nor **styler** change the order of **ggplot2** functions.

* **formatR** does not add line breaks after `+`s in **ggplot2** code.

* **styler** reformats long lines by putting each argument on its own line and indenting, for example:

```
ggplot() +
    geom_ribbon(data = ribbon, aes(
        ymin = min,
        ymax = max,
        x = x.ribbon,
        fill = 'lightgreen'
    )) +
    geom_line(data = ribbon, aes(x = x.ribbon, y = avg, color = 'black')) +
    geom_line(data = data, aes(x = x, y = new.data, color = 'red')) +
    scale_fill_identity(name = 'the fill',
                        guide = 'legend',
                        labels = c('m1')) +
    scale_colour_manual(
        name = 'the colour',
        values = c('black' = 'black', 'red' = 'red'),
        labels = c('c2', 'c1')
    ) +
    xlab('x') +
    ylab('density')
```

**ggformat** styles this code as: 

```
ggplot() +
  geom_ribbon(data = ribbon, aes(ymin = min, ymax = max, x = x.ribbon, fill = 'lightgreen')) +
  geom_line(data = ribbon, aes(x = x.ribbon, y = avg, color = 'black')) +
  geom_line(data = data, aes(x = x, y = new.data, color = 'red')) +
  scale_fill_identity(name = 'the fill', guide = 'legend', labels = c('m1')) +
  scale_colour_manual(name = 'the colour', values = c('black' = 'black', 'red' = 'red'), labels = c('c2', 'c1')) +
  xlab('x') +
  ylab('density')
```

Note: I hope to add wrapping so long lines are broken apart after commas:

```
# NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
ggplot() +
  geom_ribbon(data = ribbon, aes(ymin = min, ymax = max, x = x.ribbon, fill = 'lightgreen')) +
  geom_line(data = ribbon, aes(x = x.ribbon, y = avg, color = 'black')) +
  geom_line(data = data, aes(x = x, y = new.data, color = 'red')) +
  scale_fill_identity(name = 'the fill', guide = 'legend', labels = c('m1')) +
  scale_colour_manual(name = 'the colour', values = c('black' = 'black', 'red' = 'red'),
    labels = c('c2', 'c1')) +
  xlab('x') +
  ylab('density')
```

## Nitty Gritty

* +'s are cleaned up so there is exactly one + at the end of every line except the last, and lines ending in pipes. Specifically, double +'s are replaced with single +'s, +'s before special **ggplot2** words are removed, +'s are added back at the ends of lines.




## Known issues

* Doesn't wrap long lines

* Can't handle package namespacing such as `ggalluvial::geom_flow()`

* Can't handle comments (puts them before `+`)


I welcome your suggestions for improvements.
